      "\n",
      "Over the past few months, we have been floored by the energy and creativity redditors have displayed in the effort to save net neutrality. It was inspiring to witness [organic takeovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/) of the front page \\(twice\\), read touching [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) about how net neutrality matters in users‚Äô everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality [discussed on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7j6kn4/congress_has_set_out_a_bill_to_stop_the_fcc/) \\(with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities\\), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the [hundreds of thousands of calls](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/) they drove to Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard&utm_term=.d11780a12cc2), not to mention the [objections expressed by his fellow commissioners](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality), [the FCC‚Äôs own CTO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968), [more than a hundred members of Congress](https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf), [dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/). \n",

      "\n",
      "Many of you have asked what comes next. We don‚Äôt exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCC‚Äôs decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. It‚Äôs also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren‚Äôt subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.\n",

      "This isn‚Äôt the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you‚Äôve created. Those who thought that they‚Äôd be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. We‚Äôll keep you informed as things develop.\n",

When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.\n",
