I am a long time lurker and GME holder (80 at $154.18) but felt the need to share this idea.\\nTo Begin:\\nshares of ASO traded 8% higher today after Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (BGFV) reported EPS of .90 vs. expected .50. YES, almost double the expectation for Q1. Shares of BGFV had a 31% gain today.\\nbased of this we can expect, at MINIMUM, some sort of EPS beat for ASO when they report later this month.\\nLooking at the chart for ASO, we see that it has been trading sideways and bull-flagging nicely on the 180 day chart. With the news of BGFV's earnings beat, ASO broke out of consolidation on high volume and closed today at $33.29, just shy of ATH at $34.13.\\n5.5 million shares were traded today compared to an avg daily volume of 1.84 million. This is further confirmation of the breakout.\\n‚Äã\\nASO from end of march 2021 to today\\nASO chart from 3/19 to present day.

       "960960  good evening apes, fellow smooth brains\\nfirst off, this is not some shill FUD bs to distract you from our real fight, only an opportunity to make some quick tendies TOMORROW. I am a long time lurker and GME holder (80 at $154.18) but felt the need to share this idea.\\nTo Begin:\\nshares of ASO traded 8% higher today after Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (BGFV) reported EPS of .90 vs. expected .50. YES, almost double the expectation for Q1. Shares of BGFV had a 31% gain today.\\nbased of this we can expect, at MINIMUM, some sort of EPS beat for ASO when they report later this month.\\nLooking at the chart for ASO, we see that it has been trading sideways and bull-flagging nicely on the 180 day chart. With the news of BGFV's earnings beat, ASO broke out of consolidation on high volume and closed today at $33.29, just shy of ATH at $34.13.\\n5.5 million shares were traded today compared to an avg daily volume of 1.84 million. This is further confirmation of the breakout.\\n‚Äã\\nASO from end of march 2021 to today\\nASO chart from 3/19 to present day. (breakout)\\nBecause we are literally at ATH's, anyone short the stock is or will soon be in the red and looking to cover that position before they become a GME style fuck up.\\nASO has 30% short interest. Feel free to confirm here or anywhere else.\\nhttps://www.highshortinterest.com/\\nOn top of that, in my smooth brained opinion, ASO is still FAR undervalued at this level, even undervalued at $40.\\nDoing some simple P/E comparison with Dick's sporting goods (DKS) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) we see that.\\nASO PE = 9.2; DKS PE = 15.02, HIBB PE = 18.49.\\nNow I'm no good at math so ill leave the calculations up to you, but a PE of maybe 12 still give us an upside of nearly 33% from currently levels, or a share price of roughly $45.\\nTomorrow I fully expect ASO to at least test ATH at $34.18 and if we break above we could easily see a mini squeeze pushing the price higher potentially to $40.\\nPlay: Throw this on your watchlist and set an alert at $34.18 then buy shares or 35c's.\\nPosition:\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zddhln6d5ex61.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c1832e30d65cb0432759bd53460d183756b74ed\\nTLDR: ASO go up tmrw\\nüöÄ\\nEdit 1: Thank you kind Apes for my very first awards! :P\\nEdit 2: u/robot-legs commented that ASO released an 8k and S1 for earlier this week including preliminary sales up nearly 38%. Keep in mind, this could change before official earnings but is an amazing piece of information. here is the link  https://fintel.io/doc/sec-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-8k-2021-may-03-18750-588 \\nEdit 3: We are up 3% in premarket so farüòÅ\\n   \n",

I am a long time lurker and GME holder (80 at $154.18) but felt the need to share this idea.</p>\\n\\n<p>To Begin:</p>\\n\\n<p>shares of ASO traded 8% higher today after Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (BGFV) reported EPS of .90 vs. expected .50. YES, almost double the expectation for Q1. Shares of BGFV had a 31% gain today.</p>\\n\\n<p>based of this we can expect, at MINIMUM, some sort of EPS beat for ASO when they report later this month.</p>\\n\\n<p>Looking at the chart for ASO, we see that it has been trading sideways and bull-flagging nicely on the 180 day chart. With the news of BGFV&#39;s earnings beat, ASO broke out of consolidation on high volume and closed today at $33.29, just shy of ATH at $34.13.</p>\\n\\n<p>5.5 million shares were traded today compared to an avg daily volume of 1.84 million. This is further confirmation of the breakout.</p>\\n\\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uprn5ij95ex61.png?width=476&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f43254643682500f401f3280cc40c41d1eb17020\">ASO from end of march 2021 to today</a></p>\\n\\n<p>ASO chart from 3/19 to present day. (breakout)</p>\\n\\n<p>Because we are literally at ATH&#39;s, anyone short the stock is or will soon be in the red and looking to cover that position before they become a GME style fuck up.</p>\\n\\n<p>ASO has 30% short interest. Feel free to confirm here or anywhere else.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.highshortinterest.com/\">https://www.highshortinterest.com/</a></p>\\n\\n<p>On top of that, in my smooth brained opinion, ASO is still FAR undervalued at this level, even undervalued at $40.</p>\\n\\n<p>Doing some simple P/E comparison with Dick&#39;s sporting goods (DKS) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) we see that.</p>\\n\\n<p>ASO PE = 9.2; DKS PE = 15.02, HIBB PE = 18.49.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now I&#39;m no good at math so ill leave the calculations up to you, but a PE of maybe 12 still give us an upside of nearly 33% from currently levels, or a share price of roughly $45.</p>\\n\\n<p>Tomorrow I fully expect ASO to at least test ATH at $34.18 and if we break above we could easily see a mini squeeze pushing the price higher potentially to $40.</p>\\n\\n<p>Play: Throw this on your watchlist and set an alert at $34.18 then buy shares or 35c&#39;s.</p>\\n\\n<p>Position:</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zddhln6d5ex61.png?width=961&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c1832e30d65cb0432759bd53460d183756b74ed\">https://preview.redd.it/zddhln6d5ex61.png?width=961&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c1832e30d65cb0432759bd53460d183756b74ed</a></p>\\n\\n<p>TLDR: ASO go up tmrw</p>\\n\\n<p>üöÄ</p>\\n\\n<p>Edit 1: Thank you kind Apes for my very first awards! :P</p>\\n\\n<p>Edit 2: <a href=\"/u/robot-legs\">u/robot-legs</a> commented that ASO released an 8k and S1 for earlier this week including preliminary sales up nearly 38%. Keep in mind, this could change before official earnings but is an amazing piece of information. here is the link  <a href=\"https://fintel.io/doc/sec-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-8k-2021-may-03-18750-588\">https://fintel.io/doc/sec-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-8k-2021-may-03-18750-588</a> </p>\\n\\n<p>Edit 3: We are up 3% in premarket so farüòÅ</p>\\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->   \n",
